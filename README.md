# sos_bookmarklet
instagram photo saving bookmarklet
##About
I wanted to save some images off Instagram (on desktop) but right click "save as" saves the entire web page due to the way IG is built. With that I set out to create a little bookmarklet to target the divs that do actually hold the images and then create a list of links to those images that you can open and then just right click "save as".

Once I was done I realized it was basically a mini-JS-scraper. I also realized the UI I made was inferior to simply using this bookmarklet to set the z-index of the img containing element really high so that you COULD just right click on the images on your feed without going opening a new tab or being unsure what image corresponds to "image link 6".

Nothing earth shattering, but it was fun to make and it works!

##Usage
Open the sos_bookmarklet file, triple click or otherwise highlight all the code, with it selected drag the code up onto your bookmark bar and drop it. Rename the bookmark so you're not wondering what that nonsense is later. Go to instagram.com on your desktop, and then click the bookmark.

##Notes
Doesn't work for videos or any sites other than Instagram.
